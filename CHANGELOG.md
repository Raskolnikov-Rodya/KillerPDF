# Changelog

All notable changes to KillerPDF are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- Self-installing EXE. Running the downloaded binary now shows an Install / Run dialog. Install copies the EXE to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\KillerPDF\` (no UAC required), creates Start Menu and optional Desktop shortcuts, registers as a PDF file handler, and adds an uninstall entry to Add/Remove Programs. Uninstall self-deletes via a deferred batch file. Running a newer version from outside the install path shows an Update prompt instead.
- Command-line file argument support so file associations work: `KillerPDF.exe "file.pdf"` opens the file directly.
- Password-protected PDF support. Opening an encrypted PDF now prompts for the password instead of showing a generic error. The decrypted copy is held in a temp file for the session so all rendering and editing works normally.
- Save Flattened PDF (photo icon in toolbar). Rasterizes every page at 150 DPI via PDFium and writes them as embedded images into a new PDF, producing a fully uneditable document. Pending annotations are burned in before rasterization.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Maximize no longer covers the Windows taskbar. Added a `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` hook so the frameless window clamps to the monitor's work area (multi-monitor aware).
- Two `CS8602` nullability warnings in the font-name cleanup path.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Retargeted from .NET 8 to .NET Framework 4.8 so end users no longer need to install a separate .NET runtime.
- Forced 64-bit build via `PlatformTarget=x64`.
- Added PolySharp polyfills for modern C# language features on net48.
- Replaced `Math.Clamp` calls with `Math.Min`/`Math.Max` equivalents.

### Added
- Post-publish MSBuild target that automatically bundles a GPL3-compliant source zip alongside the published EXE.
- CHANGELOG.md.

## [1.0.1]
