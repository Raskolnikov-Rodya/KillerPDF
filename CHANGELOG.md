## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Maximize no longer covers the Windows taskbar. Added a `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` hook so the frameless window clamps to the monitor's work area (multi-monitor aware).
- Two `CS8602` nullability warnings in the font-name cleanup path.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Retargeted from .NET 8 to .NET Framework 4.8 so end users no longer need to install a separate .NET runtime.
- Forced 64-bit build via `PlatformTarget=x64`.
- Added PolySharp polyfills for modern C# language features on net48.
- Replaced `Math.Clamp` calls with `Math.Min`/`Math.Max` equivalents.

### Added
- Post-publish MSBuild target that automatically bundles a GPL3-compliant source zip alongside the published EXE.
- CHANGELOG.md.

## [1.0.1]
